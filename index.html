            <p class="lead">Version control is the task of keeping many different files with different version and configurations well organized. It also makes the user able to see all the past changes that were made and who was the person that made them. A single repository is created to manage all of the files so they are kept in one place. Team members working on the specific project are able to check out files and make changes or edits to them, then they can add them back into the master repository with the updates. Version control is essential when there are multiple people working on a single project and it can help keep all the records and files updated and edits tracked.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system or VCS is the software tool that is used to manage a projects files and changes. It automatically notes who changed the file, when the file was changed, what was different or new in the updated file, and it combines the changes into a single file. It allows users to work simultaneously without any conflicts as well as allowing for the user to revert back to old changes if something goes wrong. These systems use a local repository, repository that is on a local computer of a user, and a remote repository, the repository that is on a remote server that stores all of the files and is shared by all the team members.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a free version control system (VCS) that can be used for a variety of different project types and sizes. It is an easy to use system that is used by everyone from Google to ordinary people. Git gives every user a copy of the repository for local storage to work off of and edit or add new content. Users then must upload their local copies to the remote repository and Git prevents any overwriting, duplication, or other file management issues on the shared repository. Git has a set of basic commands that allow the user easy management of their projects and changes. Git was created in 2005 and was built for speed, simple design, and easy use for even large projects.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is an easy tool to learn how to use due to the basic and straightforward commands. To start a project the user must create the initial repository by using the command GIT INIT or by creating a remote repository the user can use the GIT REMOTE ADD ORIGIN _____ command to reference the url of the remote repository. Now that the repository is set up, use GIT ADD to add files to the repository. New files are “untracked” which means that GIT has noticed that it was not in your last snapshot. By using the GIT ADD command the file will be moved into the staging area and is ready to be committed or added to the repository. GIT COMMIT will add all the files in the staging area to the repository. Note that these are all added to the local repository and not the remote or master repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Using Remote Repositories</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">After setting up a remote repository using a website, such as github.com, the user cannot begin using the remote repository to track all of their changes with ease and without overlap. When the user has committed all of the files and changes then it is ready to be pushed and added on to the remote server. GIT PUSH is used to move all of the commits onto the remote server. Remote servers allow multiple people to work on the same project without any overlap or overwrites. The command GIT PULL is used to copy the remote repository into the local repository to make them available for edits or new content. GIT DIFF HEAD will allow the user to look at the differences between the pulled repository and the last commit by the user.</p>
